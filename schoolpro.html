            Gokhale Memorial Girls’ School is one of the most prominent heritage schools of 
            Calcutta promoting holistic education of girls in Bengal since 1920. With almost 100 years behind it, 
            the school has a very strong alumni of empowered women members from the arts to music to science to corporate. 
            The Association is now formally coming together and pooling in its intellectual resources to work towards the betterment of society. 
            We seek your kind support in this endeavor to encourage such a dedicated group to carry forward the legacy of women’s empowerment.

        <h2>School Motto</h2>
        <p>
            Our motto is to form women alive to the needs of our world, with the knowledge which gives them power to act, 
            and motivated by the love which gives them power to act, and motivated by the love which gives them purpose and 
            wisdom in their action. The education of girls from every social background has to be undertaken so that there can 
            be produced not only women of refined talents but also those great souled persons who are so desperately needed by our times. 
            Our school is a centre of human formation where every child is welcomed and loved.
        </p>
        <h2>Core Values of Our School</h2>
        <p>
